                <p>My name is Mohamed Mohamud.
                    I am currently a senior at the University of Washington's 
                    Foster School of Business studying Information Systems with a minor
                    in diversity. After gradution I will be starting full-time as a Solutions Architect for Amazon Web services.
                    During my free time, I like to build clone websites or build websites for small business from scratch. I am 
                    also a huge football fan and my goal one day is to attend all of Europe's top 5 stadiums. 
                    My skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, MySQL and Amazon Web Services. I am passionate about the different 
                    compute services of AWS and building serverless applications. Feel free to connect with me on Linkden.
